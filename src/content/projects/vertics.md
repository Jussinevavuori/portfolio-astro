# Full redesign and implementation

After I joined Vertics in 2022, I started working on their new homepage.

Initially, I was only supposed to help work on small tasks such as creating a contact form etc. for their new custom Vue site.

Soon after starting on those tasks, I started to realize how impractical and large the new design was. The site had been worked on irregularly for months with designs still remaining unfinished. It started to seem obvious the site would never get finished.

So, I took over. I created an entirely new and simplified design that not only looked stunning but also was designed for the reader. The amount of unnecessary text had been strongly reduced as few would ever read those texts in reality. In addition, most of that text was still "lorem ipsum" in the design.

After almost entirely scrapping the project, keeping only a general design theme and most of the Nuxt 3 template from the first iteration and after two months, I had reached a completed product.

Not only did I do the redesign, I was also responsible for

- Copywriting
- SEO
- Content creation
- Fun easter eggs

The site is now live, is based on Nuxt and uses headless WordPress as a CMS and receives large amounts of daily traffic.

> The page is currently in an unoptimized date and similarly to this portfolio page, might receive an Astro-svelte rewrite in the near future.
