# Serwes

<!-- The product is designed and developed by me, using the latest technologies, such as the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). I worked as lead of a team of 2-3 people. -->

Serwes is an application that enabled users to look for contractors to work on a number of different jobs or services. This includes anything from building management and asphalt work to window cleaning and bathroom renovations.

Contractors and other service providers can then make offers to any works on the platform. The best one of these offers will ultimately be selected by the user.

## The process

Serwes was designed by another developer for most part, however it was handed off to me halfway into development. There were many features lacking, requiring polish, and overall attention to quality. To my surprise, the project had been developed based on other projects of mine, utilizing a lot of my previous work. This made the handover process extremely smooth.

This was followed by a tight schedule, a fixed budget, and a long list of things that required doing. I managed to rewrite many parts of the application to a much higher quality, fix bugs and polish existing functionality, while also creating new features and improving upon the previous interface design.
