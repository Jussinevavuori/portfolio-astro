## Frontend for browsing offices

[Nooflab](https://www.nooflab.com/) has collected the most extensive, high-quality dataset on available offices, spaces, and locations. They have their own backend for this data.

The project was to create the most beautiful and user friendly frontend possible for searching this dataset to find office locations.

## Obsessing over minimal UX details.

As the project was focused on usability, a lot of time was used on making the core experience of browsing offices as easy and as intuitive as possible.

Where this is most visible is in the filters in the search page. Every input has been crafted to be as user-friendly as possible.

## Small team.

The project was created in a team of four people. I was responsible for co-designing and developing the frontend application. In addition, there was another designer responsible for creating the initial design which I used as a basis for designing th rest of the application.

In addition to this, there was Nooflab's own backend team of two people responsible for creating the backend itself, in cooperation with me to specify the data requirements in the frontend.
