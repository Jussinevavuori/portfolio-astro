# Personal portfolio page

For marketing and branding myself, I created this portfolio site. The purpose of this page is to impress and to display the best of my abilities.

## Multiple iterations

The latest iteration of the page is based on Astro, Svelte, Tailwind and Typescript. Older variations of this page have utilised Next.js and Contentful as a headless CMS.

Most likely, there will be future iterations as I use this project to explore new technologies, teach myself new skills and ensure this portfolio stays up to date both content-wise and technology-wise.
