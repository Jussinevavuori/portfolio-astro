# Verkkokokous.fi - The advanced meeting tool

Verkkokokous.fi is a web application for quick and easy-to-use online meetings and shareholders' meetings. The application includes advanced meeting management tools and voting features to enable hosting a complete meeting online.

Regular online conferences with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Zoom and other general-purpose conference tools were lacking features that enable hosting complete shareholders' meetings online. Therefore Verkkokokous.fi was created to solve a more specific problem and to cater a selection of advanced features to a targeted audience.

Some of the features of Verkkokokous.fi include

- **Highly advanced voting system** which can be customized to fit different voting scenarios
- **Video conference** implemented using Jitsi
- **Highly customizable meeting settings** to fit multiple different scenarios
- **Meeting roles** to host participants, moderators, chairpersons, secretaries and many other roles and grant access to role-specific features
- **Advanced chat feature** including public chat, chat groups and private chats
- ... and many more features that create a complete online meeting experience
