# What the Doodle - Drawing game

What the doodle is a drawing game meant to play with friends or family during casual online meetings or whenever bored.

The rules of the game are simple. Each player is given a topic, for example "a panda bear falling from a tree". The players proceed to draw the topic within the given time limit, for example 60 seconds. Then the next player is shown the previous player's drawing and they must guess what the drawing depicts. The players then take turns drawing each others' guesses and re-drawing the guessed topics, causing chaotic misunderstandings and a lot of fun. Finally, the players are shown the final drawings and they must guess which drawing is a result of their original topic.

Currently the game is only available in Finnish.
