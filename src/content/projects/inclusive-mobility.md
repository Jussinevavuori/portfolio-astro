## My first startup

After building products from scratch for years, from [verkkokokous.fi](/projects/verkkokokous-fi) to  [kaikkitoimitilat.fi](/projects/kaikkitoimitilat-fi), I had built up the skills and experience for designing and building high-quality applications from start to finish. Fast.

Now it was my time to build something for myself. Therefore, we started [Inclusive Mobility](https://inclusivemobility.im) together with Shyam Sunder. As the CTO of the company, it was my responsibility to build the application to host all the activities of our business. This includes B2C rental, B2B operations, admin management tools and automated staff features.

## High-quality design and usability

The project has been designed and developed by me alone.

The application runs on the latest technologies for both development speed and user-friendliness.

## 18 000 lines of code in 60 days

The application has a massive feature set, most of which was completed in under 60 days. This includes features such as

- Simple book and pay system
- B2B multi-tenant application
- Automated staff functionalities
- Multiple admin management features

And much more.
