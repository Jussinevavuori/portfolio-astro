# Gearhead Cloud

The product is designed and developed by me, using the latest technologies, such as the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). I worked as lead of a team of 2-3 people.

## The product

Gearhead Cloud intends to be a one-stop shop to cater all services to B2B-garages and their customers. The product allows the **garages' customers** to

- Easily send cars for maintenance
- Get notifications and follow maintenances in realtime
- Stay in contact with the garage about everything
- Defeat centralized knowledge about certain events on maintenances

And much more. **For garages**, the application provides a lot of features from billing to realtime offer requests on customer maintenances.

### The user experience

Entirely designed by me and fully optimized for both desktop and mobile usage, the application features a state of the art user experience. From snappy animated realtime updates to flashy UI details, everything feels polished.

### High technical quality

Not only is this software based on the latest technologies, it also incorporates high codebase-wide standard qualities. Architectural patterns such as the event-based architecture model for all actions in the application make the application easily extensible and highly reliable.
