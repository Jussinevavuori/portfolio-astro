## Commute Optimization

I was handed a Google Sheets application with the prompt to make it into a fully-fledged, user-friendly web application.

The goal was to design and create the application to facilitate entering data and make the output as readable and useful as possible, while optimizing the algorithm to be as cost-effective as possible.

## Rapid development

The application was completed in under three weeks. However, additional features were added in the following two weeks.

This was possible due to 90 % of the algorithm, all inputs, and required outputs being known ahead-of-time. Additionally, the project was developed with tools that enabled rapid development, such as Shadcn/UI and Firebase.
